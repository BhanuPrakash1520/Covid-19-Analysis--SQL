# Covid-19-Analysis--SQL
COVID-19 SQL Project
Project Overview

This SQL project centers around managing and analyzing COVID-19 related data. The database contains various tables encompassing COVID-19 statistics, including cases, deaths, recoveries, testing data, and more. The goal is to derive insights, trends, and analysis from this data.
Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project comprises tables with information such as:

    COVID-19 cases by region/country.
    Daily reported cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    Testing data including number of tests conducted, positivity rates, etc.
    Demographic information related to affected individuals.

Business Problem

The objective of this project is to:

    Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases over time.
    Identify regions or countries with high infection rates.
    Understand testing and positivity rates.
    Examine demographic data for affected populations.
    Perform data manipulations, queries, and transformations to derive meaningful insights.

SQL Queries and Analysis

    Total Cases vs. Total Deaths - We examine the relationship between the total number of COVID-19 cases and the total number of deaths.

    Death Percentage - We calculate the percentage of deaths relative to the total number of cases.

    Total Cases vs. Population - We analyze the total number of COVID-19 cases relative to the population of each country.

    Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population - We identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

    Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population - We identify countries with the highest death counts relative to their population.

    Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population - We analyze continents to identify those with the highest death counts relative to their population.

    Total New Cases vs. Total New Deaths Percentage - We calculate the percentage of new cases relative to new deaths.

    Total Population vs. New Vaccinations - We explore the relationship between a country's total population and the number of new vaccinations.

Instructions for Running Queries

To run queries and analyze the data:

    Connect to the database containing the COVID-19 dataset using your preferred SQL client or interface.
    Use SQL queries provided in the project files to perform analysis.
    Experiment with different queries to derive insights as needed.

Insights and Findings

The SQL queries and analyses have yielded valuable insights, including:

    Trends in daily reported cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    Regions or countries with the highest infection rates.
    Testing trends and positivity rates.
    Demographic breakdown of affected populations.

Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The insights obtained can aid in understanding the spread of the virus, testing efficacy, and demographic impacts.
